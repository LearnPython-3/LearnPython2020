# Day 1 Homework
Open up the IDLE shell.

Create a variable called foo, with a value of 1

Create a variable called bar, with a value of 1.75

Multiply foo by bar

Add foo to bar

Create a variable called baz, with a value equal to bar divided by foo

Print out the value of baz

Create a list called lst of four items: foo, bar, baz, and 12

Print out the value of the last item of lst

Change the value of the first item of lst to 1

Take a screenshot and attach it to this assignment

Don't forget to turn in!

# Day 2 Homework

Create a Python file that:

Creates a list a, containing the numbers 1 through 10 in order

For every element in a, prints it out

Creates a variable called b

Increments b until it is at least 10

For every element i of a, increment b by i, and exit the loop if b is at least 16

Prints out b

# Day 3 Homework

Create a Python file that:

Prompts the user for a number

Since the input is a string, convert it into an integer

Prompt the user for another number, and convert it into an integer

Multiply the two numbers, and print the result

Prompt the user for a string

Print out the second through fifth characters in that string, inclusive

Attach the file to this assignment, and turn it in

# Day 4 Homework

Create a Python file defining a class that does the following:

On initialization, prompts the user for input and stores is as the text property

When an object of this class is printed, it will print out its text property backwards (use string[::-1] to reverse strings)

When two objects of this class are multiplied, their text properties are concatenated

And as always, attach the file and turn it in
